                            <h3>History</h3>
                            <p>The original Scottish Fold was a white barn cat named Susie, who was found at a farm near Coupar Angus in Perthshire, Scotland, in 1961. Susie's ears had an unusual fold in their middle, making her resemble an owl. When Susie had kittens, two of them were born with folded ears, and one was acquired by William Ross, a neighbouring farmer and cat-fancier. Ross registered the breed with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) in the United Kingdom in 1966 and started to breed Scottish Fold kittens with the help of geneticist Pat Turner. The breeding program produced 76 kittens in the first three years—42 with folded ears and 34 with straight ears. The conclusion from this was that the ear mutation is due to a simple dominant gene.</p>
                            <p>Susie's only reproducing offspring was a female Fold named Sans who was also white; a second kitten was neutered shortly after birth. Three months after Sans' birth, Susie was killed by a car. All Scottish Fold cats share a common ancestry to Susie.</p>

                            <h3>Health</h3>
                            <p>Osteochondrodysplasia (OCD) is a developmental abnormality that affects cartilage and bone development throughout the body. This condition causes the fold in the breed and, in studies conducted so far, all folded cats are affected by it. Homozygous folds are affected by malformed bone structures and develop severe painful degenerative joint diseases at an early age. This condition also affects heterozygous folds, but usually to a much lesser extent and at a later age. Some will be asymptomatic.</p>
                            <p>While ethical breeders breed Fold/non-fold and not Fold/Fold (in the same way Munchkins are bred) to avoid producing homozygous folds, because heterozygous folds can also develop progressive arthritis of varying severity, some researchers recommend abandoning the breeding of folded cats entirely. For this reason the breed is not accepted by either the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy or the Fédération Internationale Féline.</p>
                            <p>CFA breeders have stated that using only fold to non-fold breeding has eliminated problems with stiff tails, shortened tails and bone lesions. In the FIFe discussion, the representative for British breeders claimed that they were not seeing the problem in their cats and that the study which showed that all heterozygous also have the condition had a small sample size. An offer of free X-rays was presented to 300 breeders to find a folded cat with healthy hind legs but it was never taken up. A similar offer was set up by the World Cat Federation together with researcher Leslie Lyons but there was also no response. FiFe stated that they will not consider recognizing Scottish Folds if breeders will not allow their breed to be scrutinized.</p>
                            <p>In a report on Scottish Folds, the Breed Standards Advisory Council (BSAC) for New Zealand Cat Fancy (NZCF) states that "Breeders may not have appreciated the strength of the evidence that heterozygous cats can and do develop [feline] OCD." While research shows that all heterozygous folds develop OCD, and anecdotal evidence shows that heterozygous folds can and do develop OCD, they do not show whether mildly affected parents are more likely to have mildly affected offspring. They also do not show what percentage of Folds are severely affected. The report states that there is not enough information to justify banning Scottish Fold matings but enough to justify a level of concern. Recommended guidelines includes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A requirement for periodic vet examination of breeding cats for any evidence of lameness, stiffness, or pain - breeding cats with signs to be desexed</li>
                                <li>A requirement for periodic x-rays of breeding cats and comparison of x-ray evidence with clinical symptoms, possibly leading to a requirement that cats with a specified degree of skeletal change to be desexed.</li>
                                <li>Requesting the agreement of pet owners to be periodically contacted by the NZCF or by a researcher, to provide reports about the health of their cat</li>
                                <li>All information to be reported /submitted to the BSAC to allow information about to be collated to give an overall picture of FOCD in Scottish Folds in NZ.</li>
                                <li>Requirements to be in place for a minimum of 5 years to enable tracking of the health of Folds over time.</li>
